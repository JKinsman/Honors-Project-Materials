# Honors-Project-Materials

This repository contains the thesis written in partial fulfillment of my Honors Project at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell.  The work was conducted under Dr. Fred G. Martin of the Computer Science Department during the Spring 2015 semester.

Partial source code for the project can be found in the appendix of the thesis.  All code written for this project is open source, and can be viewed within the iSENSE Project, which can be found at https://github.com/isenseDev/rSENSE.

This repository also contains two data sets in csv format.  These data sets are fictitious, and were constructed specifically for the user study we conducted.  The user study was designed to determine the pedagogical effectiveness of the Symbolic Regression implementation created for this research project.
